```

run some tasks some time later

```python
from scheduler import Scheduler


def hello_world(words):
    print("Hello World! ", words)


s = Scheduler()
s.daemon = True  # so the thread plays nice with shut down

# Add a task before starting the execution thread
s.schedule_task(5, hello_world, (" 5 seconds later",))

# start the execution thread
s.start()

# Add more tasks
task = s.schedule_task(3, hello_world, ("Another Task",))
